At this point, I'm pushing for this branch, and the project's updates will be posted here. All the project especifications and explications will be writen here. So for now, I'm creating the class estructure 
and the connection string for my database.

#### TO-DO: 
- Repositories
- UPDATE: After the repositories implementation, I added dependence injection ont the class Program.

#### TO-DO:
- Controllers
- UPDATE: I didn't implement the controllers because I made a mistake in it, it was necessary to map the classes with DTOs first. I was going to wait to commit, but I don't want to stop committing with each update. For the next step, I'll study more to improve the code for this mapping and make it more complete!

#### TO-DO:
- Mapping
- Validation
- UPDATE: I had a lot of bugs in the last few days, which made me feel stuck in the project. But giving up was not an option, so I tried to fix those bugs. I even managed it, but I think I can create a new phrase that says that one mistake leads to another. Anyway, let's move on.

#### TO-DO:
- fix the bugs
